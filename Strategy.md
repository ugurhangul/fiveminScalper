# 5-Minute Scalping Strategy Algorithm

## Step 1: Preparation
1. **Market Selection:**
   - Choose the market (crypto, forex, gold) based on liquidity and volatility.
   - Ensure the market is active during your trading hours.

2. **Chart Setup:**
   - Use a trading platform that allows for 4-hour and 5-minute chart views.
   - Set up the charts with clear price action visualization (candlestick charts recommended).

## Step 2: Identify the 4-Hour Candle Range
1. **Wait for the 4-Hour Candle to Close:**
   - Monitor the price action until the 4-hour candle closes.

2. **Record High and Low:**
   - Identify and note the **high** and **low** of the closed 4-hour candle.
   - Calculate the **range**: 
     \[
     \text{Range} = \text{High} - \text{Low}
     \]

## Step 3: Set Entry Levels
1. **Determine Entry Points:**
   - **Buy Entry:** Set a buy order at a price slightly above the high of the 4-hour candle (e.g., High + 0.01%).
   - **Sell Entry:** Set a sell order at a price slightly below the low of the 4-hour candle (e.g., Low - 0.01%).

## Step 4: Define Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels
1. **Set Stop-Loss:**
   - For buy orders: Place stop-loss below the low of the 4-hour candle (e.g., Low - 0.02%).
   - For sell orders: Place stop-loss above the high of the 4-hour candle (e.g., High + 0.02%).

2. **Set Take-Profit:**
   - Decide on a risk-to-reward ratio (commonly 1:2 or 1:3).
   - Calculate take-profit levels:
     - For buy orders:
       \[
       \text{Take-Profit} = \text{Entry Price} + 2 \times (\text{Entry Price} - \text{Stop-Loss})
       \]
     - For sell orders:
       \[
       \text{Take-Profit} = \text{Entry Price} - 2 \times (\text{Stop-Loss} - \text{Entry Price})
       \]

## Step 5: Execute Trades on 5-Minute Chart
1. **Monitor 5-Minute Chart:**
   - Watch for price action approaching your entry levels.
   - Be prepared to execute trades as soon as the price breaks your set entry levels.

2. **Trade Execution:**
   - Use market orders for immediate execution once the price hits your entry level.

## Step 6: Manage Trades
1. **Monitor Open Positions:**
   - Continuously observe price movements.
   - Adjust stop-loss to breakeven once the price moves favorably (if applicable).

2. **Exit Strategy:**
   - If the price reaches the take-profit level, close the trade for profit.
   - If the price hits the stop-loss level, close the trade to limit losses.

## Step 7: Post-Trade Review
1. **Analyze Trade Outcomes:**
   - Review all trades taken during the session.
   - Document winning and losing trades, noting the reasons for each outcome.

2. **Refine Strategy:**
   - Adjust entry and exit criteria based on performance analysis.
   - Consider external factors (news, market sentiment) that may have influenced trades.

3. **Maintain a Trading Journal:**
   - Keep a detailed record of trades, including entry/exit points, market conditions, and emotional state during trades.

## Additional Considerations
- **Risk Management:**
  - Only risk a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your total trading capital on each trade.
  - Diversify trades across different instruments to mitigate risk.

- **Market Conditions:**
  - Avoid trading during major news releases that could lead to high volatility.
  - Ensure that the market is trending or exhibiting clear price action patterns.

- **Emotional Discipline:**
  - Stick to the strategy without letting emotions dictate trading decisions.
  - Avoid overtrading; take breaks if experiencing consecutive losses.
